This is the project folder for the Gravitational N-Body problems project, by: Robert Burnet, Jeremy Bullock, and Cliff Vong.

Individual Contributions:
Robert Burnet : Wrote code to test algorithms, as well as code for the simulation of galaxy collisions.
Jeremy Bullock : Wrote the code for the simulation of Lagrange points of the Earth-Sun system.
Cliff Vong : Wrote the code for the simulation of 3-body scattering.

./animations/ contains all the animations (mp4) files of the simulations.

./report/ contains the report itself as a pdf and its tex file, as well as the figures used in the report.

./combined_code.py is the entire code for our project, including the integration method solvers, test cases, and simulations.
